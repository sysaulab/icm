# libicm
First implementation of the Interdependent Concurrent Multiplications, ICM, "algorithm".

ICM allow efficient entropy gathering from multicore processors by creating and observing an unstable complex system from within a program.

This allow a user to bypass traditionnal channels who may be monitored and allow operating systems and applications to access a chaotic entropy source when it was not possible before (iBook G4? Remote equipment?).

More details and test results in README.md of prandom.

Happy chaos!
